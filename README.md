# quiz-game
Math quiz written in Go

To use the math quiz:

```bash
go get github.com/mrpineapples/quiz-game
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mrpineapples/quiz-game
go run main.go -csv=problems.csv
```

**If you opt not to use `go get` you can just clone the repo anywhere on your machine and just run that last line in that directory**

Feel free to change the problems in the csv to your liking!
